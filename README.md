Enhanced Sarcasm Detection Using Hybrid CNN and Multi-Source Embeddings
![GitHub](https://github.com/HemanjaliAdini/SarcasmDetection)

## **Overview**
This project focuses on improving sarcasm detection in **online conversations** using a **hybrid CNN-BERT model** combined with **multi-source embeddings**. By integrating **personality traits, discourse-level embeddings, and content-based features**, the model aims to achieve **higher accuracy** in detecting sarcasm in social media conversations.

üîπ **Main Contributions:**
- **Hybrid Deep Learning Model** combining **CNN + BERT**
- **Multi-Source Embeddings:** Content-based, Personality, Discourse, and Stylometric features
- **Autoencoder-based Feature Fusion** for improved representation
- **Multi-Head Attention Mechanism** for contextual sarcasm detection
- **Extensive Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## **Dataset**
The model utilizes the **Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC)**, a **large-scale** dataset containing **sarcastic and non-sarcastic** comments with **conversation context**.

## **Model Architecture**
The sarcasm detection model is built using **deep learning components** designed for **context-aware detection**:
1. **Text Preprocessing & Embedding Generation**:
   - **BERT-based contextual embeddings**
   - **Stylometric, Personality, and Discourse embeddings**
   - **Feature Fusion using Autoencoders**
2. **Hybrid CNN + BERT Model**:
   - **BERT for contextual understanding**
   - **CNN for local pattern recognition (trigram features)**
   - **Multi-Head Attention Mechanism** for detecting sarcasm patterns
3. **Fully Connected Classification Layers**:
   - Dropout layers for regularization
   - Softmax activation for sarcasm classification

## **Results & Performance**
The **best-performing model** was the **Fusion Model (Personality + Content + Discourse + Stylometric embeddings)**.

üìå **Key Findings:**
- **Highest Accuracy:** **69.10%**
- **Best ROC-AUC Score:** **0.74**
- **Personality Embeddings Significantly Improve Performance**
- **Reduction in False Negatives** with context-aware embeddings

| Embedding Combination | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Stylometric + Content | 68.88% | 0.69 | 0.69 | 0.69 | 0.72 |
| Personality + Content | **69.24%** | 0.70 | 0.69 | 0.69 | **0.74** |
| Discourse + Content | 68.60% | 0.69 | 0.69 | 0.69 | 0.74 |
| **Fusion Model** | **69.10%** | 0.69 | **0.70** | **0.70** | **0.74** |
| Without Personality | 68.93% | 0.69 | 0.69 | 0.69 | 0.75 |

## **Installation & Setup**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HemanjaliAdini/SarcasmDetection.git
cd SarcasmDetection
2. Install Dependencies
