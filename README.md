Sarcasm Detection Using Hybrid CNN and Multi-Source Embeddings


Overview
This project presents an advanced sarcasm detection model leveraging Hybrid CNN and Multi-Source Embeddings. By integrating personality traits, discourse-level embeddings, and content-based features with a BERT-based model and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the approach aims to significantly improve sarcasm detection accuracy in social media conversations.

The model processes data from the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC) and applies deep learning paradigms with multiple embedding types to capture the nuances of sarcasm effectively.

Features
Hybrid CNN + BERT Model for sarcasm detection
Multi-Source Embeddings:
Content embeddings
Personality embeddings
Discourse embeddings
Stylometric embeddings
Autoencoder for Feature Fusion to improve representation
Multi-Head Attention Mechanism for context-aware sarcasm detection
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Dataset
The model utilizes the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC), a large dataset containing naturally occurring sarcastic and non-sarcastic comments from Reddit along with conversational context.

Architecture
The sarcasm detection system consists of:

Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal
Embedding generation using BERT and BERTopic models
Feature fusion using Autoencoders
BERT for Feature Extraction:
Contextual embeddings of sentences
Fine-tuning BERT for sarcasm detection
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
Captures local dependencies (trigram patterns, n-grams)
Feature extraction via Conv1D, ReLU activation, and max pooling
Multi-Head Attention Mechanism:
Enhances contextual understanding across long text sequences
Helps detect sarcasm patterns within conversational context
Classification Layer:
Fully connected layers for classification
Dropout for regularization
Softmax activation for sarcasm prediction
Results
Best Performing Model: Fusion Model (Personality + Content + Discourse + Stylometric)
Accuracy: 69.10%
ROC-AUC Score: 0.74
Reduction in False Negatives when using personality embeddings
Improved Precision-Recall Balance with feature fusion
